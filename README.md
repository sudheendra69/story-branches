## Chapter 2: The Branching Begins
The first branch was created, diverging from the main flow.  
On this branch, the story unfolded with new ideas and changes,  
each safely isolated yet connected to the root.  
It was the beginning of parallel development.
## Chapter 3: The Merge
The branches, though different, were never truly separate.  
They were destined to be merged, bringing the story into one flow again.  
Conflicts sometimes arose, but each resolution made the story stronger.  
In unity, the project found its true form.
